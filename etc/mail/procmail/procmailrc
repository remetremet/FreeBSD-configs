# Mail that is very likely spam (>12) can be saved on the server
# (not forwarded), or by moving the # down one line, even dropped
# on the floor.  Note that dropping mail on the floor is a *bad*
# idea unless you really, really believe no false positives will
# have a score greater than 12.  If you want all mail forwarded,
# just add #'s in front of each of these lines:

:0
* ^X-Spam-Level: \*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*
/dev/null
#almost-certainly-spam


# All other pass
#:0
